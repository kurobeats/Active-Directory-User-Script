**To Use:** 
Extract all files and run the powershell scripts that take your fancy from an Administrative PowerShell prompt.

**Requirements:**
* Active Directory RSAT tools installed.
* User Account with sufficient privilege to do admin things
* Windows Server 2016 (Mainly because I haven't tested on anything else)

**TODO:**
I have no idea what I'm doing. Pull requests very welcome!
